One the reasons I've started a blog is to have a place to record my journey and
adventures. Each post is a record of what I've done. This is mostly for myself,
as sometimes I get back to same point doing a different path and its nice to
mark those points. Part of an adventure is a lot of browsing and learning of
new things. Some of the gems I find are not related to the subject in matter,
but non the less I want to save it for other time. I end up with huge pile of
open tabs in Firefox. Which right now I manage with tab groups and smart key
bindings but its really not such a good system. Also I want to share those gems
just as much as my posts, but not all of them fit in. But today I think I found
something that might work.

My wife asked me about how I manage my tasks and personal thoughts, so I told
her about Vim-wiki. She is not a Vim user, so I just showed her how a personal
wiki works for me. Next, she decides that its only true to give me back her gem
of productivity and gives me introduction to [Pocket][1]. I've noticed this
[Pocket thingy in newer versions of Firefox][2], but I didn't give it a lot of
thought. After showing it to me, I thought "Is there a way I can share the things
in my pocket". Quick web search gave me [this little amazing gem][3]. I was
amazed as it was exactly what I wanted.

[Jessica Lord][4] created amazingly simple solution that creates:

 > "A website for your Pocket article archive. Fork-n-Go set up."

Using IFTTT, you stream the saved web sites in Pocket to a Google sheet, and
her amazing repository just parse the Google sheet into a cool web site.
